About Ashoka India
Ashoka India has been supporting social entrepreneurs who are creating positive change in the country from last few decades. The first-ever social entrepreneur to be selected as an Ashoka Fellow was Gloria De Souza from India who revolutionised the system of learning in classrooms.
Impacting millions of people and communities through their work, our Fellows include people like Nobel Laureates
Kailash Satyarthi
(Bachpan Bachao Andolan) and Magsaysay awardee
Anshu Gupta
(Goonj),
Harish Hande
(SELCO),
Chetna Gala Sinha
(Mann Deshi Foundation),
Shanti Raghavan
(Enable India),
Shaheen Mistri
(Teach for India), among several others. Currently, we have over 500 Ashoka Fellows in India in wide-ranging fields such as poverty alleviation, farming, education, livelihoods, finance, local media, and women & youth empowerment, across India.
In the course of our work, having witnessed the changing patterns in society over the last few decades, and the way our problems are increasing at a pace faster than we can solve them, we have realised that to truly make things better for everyone we need to head towards a world where everyone is a changemaker. And just like social entrepreneurs, the world needs everyone to start developing and practising abilities and skills such as empathy, teamwork, leadership, and problem solving.
To this end, we believe that changemaking has to start young, and in the last few years we have developed a program for young changemakers called
Ashoka Young Changemakers
.  Ashoka India functions as a collaborative network that supports and amplifies change by bringing together these changemakers.
We also organise programs in partnership with other institutions (Schools, Universities et al) with a vision that these institutions have to develop everyone's potential to be a changemaker in their community.
Our office also serves as the regional hub for Ashoka’s activities in South Asia. Find out more about our work in

Ashoka
(formerly branded
Ashoka: Innovators for the Public
) is an American-based
nonprofit organization
that promotes
social entrepreneurship
by connecting and supporting individual social entrepreneurs. Ashoka invests in over 3,800 social entrepreneurs in over 90 countries worldwide.
[

]
These individuals in turn become the people that others will try to follow by example.
[
7
]
Social entrepreneurship also supports teens and gives them a way to flourish, to grow independently,
[
8
]
while continuing to find support from those around them. An example of this independence is the way that young Asian teens, whose ultimate goal is to attend and eventually graduate from college use the business skills that they have learned will go a long way to meeting this ultimate goal.
[
9
]
It is this change making experience that Ashoka offers everyone.  globalization of social entrepreneurship benefits many. When jobs are created; not only does the economy benefit but society benefits as well from this entrepreneurship.  But making sure that everyone involved receives the same number of benefits is a challenge.  Not only is there a wealth discrepancy but exploitation has to be curbed in order for the positive benefits to increase.
[
10
]
There are some benefits to an organization that helps young people experience their dreams but there is also a lot of hard work involved.  The bank does not loan money without sufficient evidence that the money would be put to good use, either back into the community or given to those individuals who promote social entrepreneurship. Those interested in making a change for the better will be able to achieve their dreams with the help of Ashoka.  Ashoka uses open communication and the public platform to get ideas from the public.  These ideas could change the way people solve difficult problems.
[
11
]
It is these ideas that form the basis of the social entrepreneurship concept.
History
[
edit
]
Growing up,
Bill Drayton
was inspired by
Mahatma Gandhi
and the
Civil Rights Movement
.
[
12
]
Drayton wanted to mitigate income inequality through social entrepreneurship.
[
12
]
Drayton
founded
Ashoka in 1980.
[

]
[
2
]
The organization was named after the
Emperor Ashoka The Great
, the ruler of the
Maurya Empire
during the 3rd century BC.
[
13
]
Emperor Ashoka recognized the suffering that
he had caused by unifying his empire
, and he
promoted religious and philosophical tolerance
and the paramount importance of morality when working for the public.

Fellows
[
edit
]
Ashoka identifies
social entrepreneurs
with solutions to social problems who seek to make large-scale changes to society. Ashoka searches for individuals who have vision, creativity, and determination and are
motivated by public gain
rather than personal gain.
[
15
]
Social entrepreneurs who pass the selection process are called Ashoka fellows.
[
16
]
Each Ashoka fellow receives a financial
stipend
that they can use to pay for their personal expenses so that they can fully devote their time to the pursuit of their innovative social ideas.  The size of the stipend is decided on a case-by-case basis, according to the cost of living in the entrepreneur's local area.  The stipend is available for up to three years.  The organization is very clear that the stipend is only for living expenses and not for funding the social entrepreneur's initiative or organization.
[
17
]
Ashoka fellows are connected with successful entrepreneurs in order to help the fellows succeed in implementing their social ideas.

although it has partnered with governments on projects
[
23
]
and it received a $1,585,600
Paycheck Protection Program
loan in 2020.

While Ashoka says it does not
petition
governments for social change, it provides advice to organizations such as the
World Bank
when requested.

Citizen-sector organization
[
edit
]
While the United States
Internal Revenue Service
has approved Ashoka's headquarters as a
501(c)(3)
nonprofit organization
, and some countries consider Ashoka to be a
non-governmental organization
, Ashoka itself prefers the term citizen-sector organization in order to emphasize what it is, rather than what it is not.
[
25
]
According to Ashoka, citizen-sector organizations are groups of citizens who care and act to serve others and cause needed change.
